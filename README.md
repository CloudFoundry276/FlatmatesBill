Advanced Python: Python OOP with 10 Real-World Programs, App 2

In this project, we use flask, wtforms, filestack, fpdf, os and webbrowser libraries.

Using flask views and wtforms we created web forms i.e. website / webapp to get input from users and display output as per provided data.

In this app, we take monthly rent amount (e.g. 1000) in rupees or dollar and month of rent (e.g. December 2021).

After getting rent input data, we get name and number of days of two users stay for that month on rent.

After getting all data, we calculate rent of each user have to pay for that perticular month.
